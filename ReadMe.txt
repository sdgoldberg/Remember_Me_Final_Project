I was able to get the GUI to work, however I encountered a bug where a contact’s name is entered into ContactList twice when calling scan.nextLine(). I will work on this bug for the next phase of the assignment.

The opening screen requests that the user input a text file and then, once the user presses “enter” the mainScene is opened
 
The stars on each contact are clickable and will be implemented to make a favorites list
